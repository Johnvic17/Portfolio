ðŸš€ #Kicking off a crucial project for my journey as a developer â€” my portfolio!

After spending some time away from coding and focusing mainly on studying, Iâ€™m finally putting my knowledge into practice. It feels great to see ideas coming to life, and I know thereâ€™s still a long road ahead. Tech is a vast ocean, and weâ€™re all constantly learning and exploring.ðŸŒŠ
For this first version, Iâ€™m working with:
 âœ… React
 âœ… JavaScript (ES6)
 âœ… HTML & CSS
These core front-end technologies, when used well, can deliver amazing results â€” and thatâ€™s exactly what Iâ€™m aiming for. I also plan to add TailwindCSS soon to bring even more customization and a polished design.
One of the highlights so far is a Rubikâ€™s Cube built with THREE.js / React Three Fiber (R3F). And yes, I had some help from the brand-new GPT-5, which has been an incredible tool â€” providing faster, clearer, and more efficient answers for us devs.
This is just the beginning, but Iâ€™ll keep sharing updates both here
